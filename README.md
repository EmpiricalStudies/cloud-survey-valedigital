# A Context-Driven Survey on the State of Cloud Adoption in Micro \& Small Brazilian IT Companies

> Micro & small companies are essential for Brazilian IT market. For instance, 95.5% of Brazilian software development companies are considered micro (up to 9 employees) or small (up to 99 employees). Cloud computing plays a key role to reducing infrastructure and personnel costs in small companies. Therefore, identifying whether perceptions and practices of micro & small Brazilian IT companies (MSBCs) on cloud adoption are in line with other companies worldwide is central to ensure their competitiveness. We conducted a survey research with 93 MSBCs, from which we received 29 valid responses (31% response rate). Eighty-three percent of surveyed companies are currently using cloud, 65% of cloud users in our survey use more than one cloud provider, and 54% of current cloud users reported issues when using cloud services. Compared to related surveys, we did not find significant differences regarding perceptions and practices of cloud adoption. This suggests that cloud adoption may not differ significantly regardless of the company size and region.
