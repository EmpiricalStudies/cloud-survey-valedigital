# A Survey on the State of Cloud Adoption in Micro & Small Brazilian IT Companies 

> Micro & small companies are essential for Brazilian IT market. For instance, 95.5% of Brazilian software development companies are micro or small. Although cloud computing plays a key role in reducing infrastructure and personnel costs in small companies, little is known on the state of cloud adoption in micro & small Brazilian IT companies (MSBCs). If cloud adoption in MSBCs differs significantly from other companies around the world, MSBCs may need tailored training and tools. Moreover, these differences may limit MSBCs competitiveness in the global IT market. To understand the state of cloud adoption in MSBCs, we partnered with a regional IT association to conduct a survey with their 93 associated companies, from which we received 29 valid responses (31% response rate). Eighty-three percent of surveyed companies are currently using cloud, 65% of cloud users in our survey use more than one cloud provider, and 54% of current cloud users reported issues when using cloud services. Compared to related surveys, we did not find significant differences regarding perceptions and practices of cloud adoption. This result suggests that cloud adoption may not vary significantly with company size and region.
